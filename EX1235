//1.2.35 Dragon curves. Write a program to print the
// instructions for drawing the
//        dragon curves of order 0 through 5. The
//        instructions are strings of F, L, and R
//        characters, where F means “draw line while
//        moving 1 unit
//        forward,” L means “turn left,” and R means
//        “turn right.” A
//        dragon curve of order n is formed when you fold
//        a strip
//        of paper in half n times, then unfold to right
//        angles. The
//        key to solving this problem is to note that a
//        curve of order
//        n is a curve of order n-1 followed by an L
//        followed by a
//        curve of order n-1 traversed in reverse order,
//        and then
//        to figure out a similar description for the
//        reverse curve.
